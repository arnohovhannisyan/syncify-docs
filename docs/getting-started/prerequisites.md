## Repo Syncer

These are the prerequisites for using the default `repo` syncer. For most people, these steps will be required, but if you plan on using another syncer, you may skip them.

### Install Git

Navigate to https://git-scm.com/downloads to download and install the latest version of Git on your machine. Operating system-specific instructions can be found there.

### Configure Git

To use Git, you must first configure it by providing your name and email. To do this, run the following in your terminal, replacing the placeholders with the corresponding values.

```sh
git config --global user.name "<Your Name>"
git config --global user.email "<Your Email>"
```
